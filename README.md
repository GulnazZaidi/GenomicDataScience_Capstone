## Differential gene expression analysis of adult and fetal Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex samples of human brain 
This project aims to understand the difference in Gene expression between Fetal and adult human brain cells. The primary data used in this project is transcriptome sequencing data (known as RNA-seq) from human post-mortem brains, sequenced on the Illumina platform. The "total" RNA samples from BioProject PRJNA245228 at the Short Read Archive were used for this study. 4 samples each from the fetal and adult age group were used.
